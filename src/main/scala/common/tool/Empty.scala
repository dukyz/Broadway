  * @todo Just an Empty class.So one class cloud extends Empty and then with Trait.
  *       So it's will be convenient to see "with a Trait not extends a Trait".
  *       And it's also used for code generate.
  *
  *       eg: class TTT extends Trait1. feels uncomfortable.right?
  *           class TTT extends Empty with Trait1.  Ha~~~
